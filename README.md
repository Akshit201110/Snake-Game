# Snake Game 
This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic Snake Game, developed without the use of external game development libraries, focusing on fundamental logic-building and core Python functionalities.

Key Features:

Library Utilization:
The game is created using standard Python libraries such as tkinter for graphical interface development (if GUI-based) or basic curses/time modules for console-based rendering and real-time movement. It showcases how built-in libraries can be used creatively to simulate dynamic gameplay without relying on external frameworks.

Logic Building:
The core game logic includes real-time snake movement, food generation at random positions, collision detection (with walls and the snake’s own body), and score updating. Strong algorithmic thinking is applied to manage the snake’s growth, input handling, and game-over conditions.

Game Mechanics:
Features include smooth directional controls via keyboard input, automatic snake movement with speed control, and continuous gameplay until collision. The modular and clear coding structure ensures maintainability and easy adjustments to game speed or grid size.

Scalability and Extensibility:
The code is organized for easy future enhancements, such as adding new levels, special food items, scoreboards, or sound effects.
